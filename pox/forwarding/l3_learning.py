A stupid L3 switch

For each switch:
1) Keep a table that maps IP addresses to MAC addresses and switch ports.
   Stock this table using information from ARP and IP packets.
2) When you see an ARP query, try to answer it using information in the table
   from step 1.  If the info in the table is old, just flood the query.
3) Flood all other ARPs.
4) When you see an IP packet, if you know the destination port (because it's
   in the table from step 1), install a flow for it.
